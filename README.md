## Getting Started  

### What is RabbitMQ?  
RabbitMQ is a message broker that enables various applications to communicate with one another by sending messages through queues. It utilizes concepts like exchanges, bindings, and queues to manage message flow efficiently.  

### Installing RabbitMQ  
To install RabbitMQ, we'll be using Docker. This section will guide you through the installation process.  

### Publishing and Consuming Messages  
You'll learn how to publish messages to a queue and retrieve them using a consumer.  

### Message Acknowledgment  
Understand the importance of acknowledging messages to ensure reliable message processing.  

### AMQP & MQTT  
Explore how the AMQP protocol works and its relationship with MQTT.  

### Message Routing with Topics  
Learn advanced routing techniques with topics and routing keys to filter messages effectively.  

### Dead Letter Exchanges (DLX) and Queues (DLQ)  
What happens to messages that cannot be processed? Discover the importance of DLX and DLQ in error handling.  

### Exchanges and Queues  
Understand the different types of exchanges and their roles in message delivery.  

### Scalability & Load Balancing  
Learn strategies to scale your RabbitMQ setup and balance load across consumers.  

### Specialized Queues and Patterns  
Explore various queuing patterns that can help solve specific messaging problems.  

### Full Stack Project in Node.js with Microservices Architecture  
A practical example demonstrating the integration of RabbitMQ in a full-stack application setup.
